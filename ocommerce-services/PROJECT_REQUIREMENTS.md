### 3. Catalog Domain [x]

### 4. Cart, Order & Payment Domains [x]

### 5. Reviews Domain [ ]

### 6. Notifications Domain [ ]

# Mark each item as [x] when complete. Only start the next phase when requested.

## Branching Requirement

- For each implementation phase, create a new git branch named after the phase (e.g., `feature/user-domain`, `feature/catalog-domain`, `feature/cart-order-payment-domains`). Merge to the main branch only after the phase is complete and reviewed. This ensures clean separation of work and easier code reviews.

## Project Overview

This project is an e-commerce RESTful API built with Spring Boot, following a modular monolith architecture and Domain-Driven Design principles. It supports both PostgreSQL and MongoDB databases and implements JWT-based authentication with access and refresh tokens.

---

## General Requirements

- Provide a `docker-compose.yml` file to create and run all required databases (PostgreSQL and MongoDB) for local development. The file should allow developers to start/stop the databases using simple command-line commands (e.g., `docker compose up -d`). Include example environment variables, ports, and persistent volumes for data storage. Document usage instructions in the README.

- The project must support API documentation using Swagger (OpenAPI). Include the necessary dependencies (such as springdoc-openapi or springfox), and configure Swagger UI for interactive API exploration and testing.
- All primary keys for entities must use UUID v4 as the primary key type. This applies to all tables/entities in PostgreSQL and MongoDB collections where applicable.
- For each domain, use Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) as response objects for all API endpoints. Entities should be confined to the service layer and below; never expose entities directly in controller responses.

* Structure the codebase by domain (e.g., order, user, product), with each domain having its own sub-packages for domain models, application services, infrastructure (repositories), and web (controllers).
* Support both PostgreSQL (relational) and MongoDB (NoSQL) databases:
  - Include spring-boot-starter-data-jpa and PostgreSQL JDBC driver for relational data.
  - Include spring-boot-starter-data-mongodb for document data.
  - Manually configure separate DataSource, EntityManagerFactory, and TransactionManager beans for PostgreSQL.
  - Configure MongoDatabaseFactory and MongoTemplate beans for MongoDB.
  - Use @Entity and JpaRepository for PostgreSQL models.
  - Use @Document and MongoRepository for MongoDB models.
  - Provide example configuration classes and sample application.properties entries for both databases.
  - Ensure service and repository layers interact with the correct database per domain.
* Add JWT-based authentication supporting both access and refresh tokens:
  - Include dependencies for Spring Security and JJWT in Maven.
  - Implement a JWT utility class for token generation, validation, and claim extraction, with configurable secret and expiration times.
  - Create a UserDetailsService to load user data.
  - Build an authentication REST controller with endpoints for login (returns access and refresh tokens), token refresh, and logout (invalidates refresh tokens).
  - Configure Spring Security for stateless JWT authentication, disabling CSRF and session management.
  - Add a custom JwtAuthenticationFilter to validate tokens from the Authorization header.
  - Store refresh tokens securely in the database for revocation and lifecycle management.
  - Provide example code for each component and sample configuration.

## Domain Requirements

### User Domain

**Testing:**

- Write unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for the User domain; use test containers for DB-dependent tests.

<!-- Start implementation when requested -->

**Database:**
User Domain uses PostgreSQL for data storage.

**API Endpoints:**

- `[POST] /auth/signup` — Register a new user (no authentication required)
- `[POST] /auth/login` — Authenticate a user (no authentication required)
- `[GET] /users/me` — Retrieve the current authenticated user (authentication required)

**Authentication:**

- `/auth/signup` and `/auth/login` are public routes.
- `/users/me` and `/users` require JWT authentication.

**User Entity:**

- Implement a `User` entity that extends Spring Security's `UserDetails` interface.
- `getAuthorities()` returns the user's roles list (return an empty list for now; role-based access control is not covered).
- `getUsername()` returns the user's email address (must be unique).
- Methods `isAccountNonExpired()`, `isAccountNonLocked()`, `isCredentialsNonExpired()`, and `isEnabled()` should return `true` (customize logic as needed).

**Repository:**

- Create a CRUD repository for the `User` entity using Spring Data JPA.

**Notes:**

**Address Management:**

- Users can add multiple addresses to their profile (e.g., home, work, shipping, billing, etc.).
- Users can modify or delete address information.
- When a user updates or deletes an address, the old address record should be marked as deleted (soft delete), and a new address record should be created for the updated data.
- Addresses must never be hard deleted from the database; always use soft delete/versioning.
- Each order must capture both shipping and billing address information, referencing the user's address records at the time of order placement.

**Notes:**

- Ensure proper validation and error handling for authentication, registration, and address management.
- You may extend these requirements as needed for user profile management or additional features.

### Catalog Domain

**Testing:**

- Write unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for the Catalog domain; use test containers for DB-dependent tests.

<!-- Start implementation when requested -->

**Database:**
Catalog Domain uses MongoDB for data storage.

**Category Hierarchy:**

- Categories are hierarchical and can have child categories.
- A product can belong to more than one category.

**Product and Variant Structure:**

- Product document includes:
  - Name
  - Short description
  - Long description
  - Thumbnail URL
  - Image URLs
  - Price
  - Unit of measure
  - SEO metadata fields
  - List of variants
- Variant document includes:
  - SKU information
  - Defining attributes (each variant can have different values for these attributes)

**Category Structure:**

- Category document includes:
  - Name
  - Description
  - Thumbnail URL
  - List of child categories

**Repository:**

- Create CRUD repositories for both Product and Category documents using Spring Data MongoDB.

**API Endpoints:**

- Implement only GET APIs for now (e.g., get products, get categories, get product by ID, get category by ID).
- Plan to add admin catalog APIs for Create, Update, Delete operations in the future.

### Cart, Order & Payment Domains

**Testing:**
- Write unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for all three domains; use an in-memory database for DB-dependent tests (refer to User Domain test configuration for setup and usage; do not use TestContainers).

<!-- Start implementation when requested -->

**Database:**
All three domains use PostgreSQL for data storage.

- Use this document as a living specification for the OCommerce Services.

---

## Best Practices

- Implement audit logging to track changes to critical data (orders, payments, user profile changes, etc.) for compliance and troubleshooting.
- Apply soft delete (logical deletion) for all entities where appropriate (e.g., products, users, orders) to support audit/history and prevent hard deletes.
- Expose endpoints for health and readiness checks to support cloud/Kubernetes deployments.
- Implement global exception handling using @ControllerAdvice and return standardized error responses.
- Use Bean Validation (javax.validation) annotations for all request DTOs and validate incoming data at the API boundary.
- Use structured logging (e.g., SLF4J with Logback), mask sensitive data in logs, and integrate with monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, ELK).
- Externalize configuration using application.properties/yml and environment variables; use Spring Profiles for environment-specific configs.
- Use HTTPS in production and store secrets securely (environment variables, vault, etc.).
- Apply the principle of least privilege for all roles and services.
- Version APIs (e.g., /api/v1/...) to support future changes without breaking clients.
- Implement pagination, sorting, and filtering for all list endpoints.
- Protect APIs from abuse with rate limiting and throttling.
- Write unit, integration, and end-to-end tests; use test containers for DB-dependent tests.
- Keep API and architecture documentation up to date; document business rules and edge cases.
- Use static code analysis tools (e.g., SonarQube, Checkstyle) and enforce code formatting/style guides.
- Keep dependencies up to date and regularly scan for vulnerabilities (e.g., OWASP Dependency-Check).
- Set up CI/CD pipelines to automate builds, tests, and deployments.
- Design for internationalization (i18n) if needed.
- Use caching (e.g., Redis, Caffeine) for frequently accessed data.
